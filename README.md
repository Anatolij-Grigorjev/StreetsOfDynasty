# StreetsOfDynasty
A mechanics prototype in Godot trying to use Dynasty Warriors-style large-scale melee weapon based combat in an isometric 2D streets-of-rage style setting

## Status
On hiatus as the point of the POC was to see how feasible was it to make a State Machine-based combo chain system from Dynasty Warriors work in a 2d Godot context, with some juicy effects/sounds/animations/etc.

At some point this may be taken as base code to fledge out a complete game
